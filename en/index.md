### 1. Issue

Bitcoin is often pointed as a strong candidate to become the world-wide reserve currency. However, though it has become one of the main assets used as store of value, it is not yet adopted worldwide as a mean of exchange. The explanation to this fenomenon can be split in two aspects:

#### 1.1 Currency paradox (Saving Paradox)

Derived from Gresham's Law, comes the "Saving Paradox":

"_Ceteris Paribus_, rational agents prefer spend currencies with low potential as store of value, while they tend to accumulate currencies with greater potential as a store of value for future exchanges."

For example, if an rational agent receives half of it's salary in dollars, and the other half in venezuelan bolívars, your rational atitude is to spend first the venezuelan bolívars and reserve the dollars for future exchanges, once this one can, relatively, keep its value better through time.

Bitcoin, being the less inflationary currency existent and with greater potential as store of value through time, tends to be accumulated, and not spend, reducing its using as a mean of exchange.

#### 1.3 Layered Money

The direct using of Bitcoin as a store of value and mean of exchange violates the concept of Layered Money, elaborated extensively on the Allan Schramm's article "Bitcoin, the system of final settlement." and the book "Layered Money" from Nik Bhatia. Gold wasn't used extensivelly as a mean of exchange, but through layers that made it usefull as a mean of exchange.

Observing the evolution of the using of gold as the basis of the monetary system, it's possible to divide it in four layers: the first being the metal itself after extraction, gold nuggets in their original form. The second layer is the standardization of this material into gold bars that follow high standards of purity, shape, measurement and weight. The third is gold certificates, where these bars, difficult to transport and divide, were "tokenized". The fourth layer is the banknotes as they were known before the end of the gold standard, backed by these certificates that circulate en masse.

Each of these layers have distinct attributes and focuses to perform their respective functions. The notion that Bitcoin in it's raw form would maximize all the needed caracteristics of a monetary system (store of value, mean of exchange and unit of account) does not allign with the history of money in humanity.
